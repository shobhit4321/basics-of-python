# A python 3 program using recursive to count numbers 
# with sum of digits as given 'sum' 

# Recursive function to count 'n' digit 
# numbers with sum of digits as 'sum' 
# This function considers leading 0's 
# also as digits, that is why not 
# directly called 
def countRec(n, sum) : 
	
	# Base case 
	if (n == 0) : 
		return (sum == 0) 

	if (sum == 0) : 
		return 1

	# Initialize answer 
	ans = 0

	# Traverse through every digit and 
	# count numbers beginning with it 
	# using recursion 
	for i in range(0, 10) : 
		if (sum-i >= 0) : 
			ans = ans + countRec(n-1, sum-i) 

	return ans 
	
	
# This is mainly a wrapper over countRec. It 
# explicitly handles leading digit and calls 
# countRec() for remaining digits. 
def finalCount(n, sum) : 
	
	# Initialize final answer 
	ans = 0

	# Traverse through every digit from 1 to 
	# 9 and count numbers beginning with it 
	for i in range(1, 10) : 
		if (sum-i >= 0) : 
			ans = ans + countRec(n-1, sum-i) 

	return ans 


# Driver program 
n = 2
sum = 5
